// Getting the nav bar to higlight on the hover
function highlight_navlink(linkname){

  console.log(linkname)
  linkname.className += " active"
  console.log(linkname)

}

// so basically I think I know how to add an active class
// I first need to remove the active class from all of the navlinks
// then i need to add the "active" class to the nav link that was clicked
// for some reason that background-color doesnt stay which is weird
// need to figure out why it wont stay...
// PROGRESS!! =)
